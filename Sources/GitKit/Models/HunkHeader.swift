/// A unified-diff hunk header: `@@ -oldStart[,oldCount] +newStart[,newCount] @@ [section]`.
///
/// This existed three times before it existed once — twice inside this package
/// (``Git/lineDiff(for:repoRoot:)`` and ``Git/lineChangesAll(repoRoot:)``) and once in
/// Sidewatch's side-by-side viewer, which had drifted into a weaker variant: it read only the
/// two start lines, ignored the counts entirely, and so could not tell an addition from a
/// modification or spot a pure deletion. Every consumer of a `git diff` needs this exact
/// parse, so it belongs with the git wrapper rather than being re-derived per view.
///
/// The counts are genuinely load-bearing, which is why the weaker variant was a latent bug and
/// not merely duplication: `oldCount == 0` means text was only added, `newCount == 0` means it
/// was only removed, and the difference decides whether a line is marked added, modified, or
/// deleted. See ``changeKind``.
