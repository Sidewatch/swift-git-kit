/// `Git` is a namespace (a caseless `enum`) — you never instantiate it; call the
/// static methods directly:

/// ```swift
/// import GitKit
///
/// guard let root = Git.repoRoot(for: someFileURL) else { return }
/// for change in Git.status(repoRoot: root) {
///     print(change.path, change.kind)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Every call shells out to ``executable`` synchronously and is cheap. When
/// scanning a whole repository, run these off the main queue.
///
/// The operations are grouped across the package:
/// - Status: ``status(repoRoot:)``
/// - Diff: ``lineChanges(for:repoRoot:)``, ``removedLines(for:repoRoot:)``
/// - Blame: ``blame(for:line:repoRoot:)``
/// - Actions: ``stage(_:repoRoot:)``, ``unstage(_:repoRoot:)``, ``discard(_:kind:repoRoot:)``
/// - Worktrees: ``currentBranch(repoRoot:)``, ``worktrees(repoRoot:)``
///
/// - Note: This wraps the `git` executable rather than linking libgit2, so a
///   working `git` must be installed at ``executable``.
